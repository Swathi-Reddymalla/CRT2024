Sample Output 0

program
Sample Input 1

Th%is is m67$y pro***gram
Sample Output 1

This is my program


#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char str[201]; // Assuming the maximum length of the string is 200
    int i = 0;

    // Input the string
    
    fgets(str, sizeof(str), stdin);

    // Iterate through each character in the string
    while (str[i] != '\0') {
        // Check if the character is a special symbol or a whitespace
        if (!((str[i] >= 'A' && str[i] <= 'Z') || (str[i] >= 'a' && str[i] <= 'z'))) {
            i++;
            continue; // Skip the character if it's a special symbol or a whitespace
        }
        printf("%c", str[i]); // Print the alphabet
        i++;
    }

    return 0;
}
