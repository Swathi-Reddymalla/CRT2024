Electricity board has decided to charge rupees based on the units consumed by a particular home. If the units consumed is less than or equal to 200, the cost for one unit is 0.5. If the unit is less than or equal to 400, the cost for one unit is 0.65 and Rs.100 extra charge. If the unit is less than or equal to 600, the cost for one unit is 0.80 and Rs.200 extra charge. If the unit is greater than 600 the cost for one unit is 1.25 and Rs.425 extra charge. You need to now calculate the electricity bill based on the units consumed (given input).

Input Format

Input consists of one integer. This corresponds to the units consumed.

Constraints

1<=n<=10^7

Output Format

The output consists of one integer. This corresponds to the electricity bill in rupees.

Sample Input 0

200
Sample Output 0

Rs.100




#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int units;
    
    // Reading input from user

    scanf("%d", &units);
    
    // Variables to hold cost per unit and extra charge
    float cost_per_unit;
    int extra_charge = 0;
    
    // Determine cost per unit and extra charge based on units consumed
    if (units <= 200) {
        cost_per_unit = 0.5;
    } else if (units <= 400) {
        cost_per_unit = 0.65;
        extra_charge = 100;
    } else if (units <= 600) {
        cost_per_unit = 0.80;
        extra_charge = 200;
    } else { // units > 600
        cost_per_unit = 1.25;
        extra_charge = 425;
    }
    
    // Calculate total bill
    float total_bill = units * cost_per_unit + extra_charge;
    
    // Print the bill
    printf("Rs.%d\n", (int)total_bill); // casting to int to remove decimal places
    
    return 0;
}
