An English school teacher is teaching how to build sentences for kindergarten students. She starts by teaching two words in a sentence, then 3 words and so on. The next step is that she asks the students to find which word in the sentence they have made has the maximum number of alphabets. The task here is to write program to find the longest word in each input sentence(str).

        }
    }

    // Check for the last word if it's the longest
    max_length = (current_length > max_length) ? current_length : max_length;

    return max_length;

    fgets(sentence, sizeof(sentence), stdin);

    int result = longest_word_length(sentence);

    printf("%d\n", result);
