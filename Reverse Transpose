There is a treasure full of gold and diamonds. Jack Sparrow successfully reached the cave with his black pearl. He is reading a hint on a box that he need to tilt it 90 degree clock wise. But he don't know what to tilt. Finally when he reaches the door there is a dial pad. He remember the hint in the box and he opened the box where it has numbers printed in N x N form. Now he is tilting the same to 90 degree and seeing the numbers. He couldn't see and type on same time. So write a program to print the 2D matrix which will be helpful for him to type easily.

Input Format

Read size of rows and columns Read elements of matrix

Constraints

1<=n<=10^7

Output Format

Print the matrix as described above

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n;
    scanf("%d", &n);

    int matrix[n][n];
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            scanf("%d", &matrix[i][j]);
        }
    }
// Printing the 2D matrix after tilting it 90 degrees clockwise
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            printf("%d ", matrix[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
